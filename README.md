# data_analysis_with_R_udacity

The assignments and programming tasks of free course included in Data Analyst Nanodegree offered by Facebook at Udacity. 

I've created Jupyter Notebooks for each lesson to include code as well as class notes which will help the reader to get tutorial experience rather than reading just dry code. 

Requirements :

1. Anaconda 4.3
2. R version 3.40 and above
3. Jupyter Noteboosk is provided by Anaconda
